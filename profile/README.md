# CommunityCharts
ClassCharts is *somewhat* closed-source which is sad! CommunityCharts intends to open-source the ClassCharts codebase.

_CommunityCharts, and it's repositories, are **NOT** affiliated with ClassCharts, or Tes. All work here is done by members of the CommunityCharts organisation. We do not intend to hurt any companies in this process._
