# CommunityCharts
ClassCharts is *somewhat* closed-source which is sad! However, they send full client code over to the user because of webpacks! This means you can see it's source code. However, CommunityCharts was made to make repositories that allow you to clone a local copy of the ClassCharts code and use it for whatever you'd want.

_CommunityCharts, and it's repositories are **NOT** affiliated with ClassCharts, or Tes. All work here is done by members of the CommunityCharts organisation. We do not intend to hurt any companies in this process._
